# The Algorithm for data protection

#### Task: 
- The method of data transformation to protect the personal information of the clients of the insurance company.. 

#### Description:
- To protect the data of clients of the insurance company, data conversion methods have been developed so that it would be difficult to recover personal information from them.
Data preprocessing was carried out. The operation of the algorithm of the linear regression model when multiplied by an invertible matrix is checked. The effect of multiplication on an invertible matrix and then multiplication on an inverse invertible matrix is checked. The R2 metric of the Linear Regression was checked on identical data - first the original data, then multiplied by an invertible matrix, the size of which is equal to the number of features. The metrics are completely the same. It can be concluded that the algorithm works.
